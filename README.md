# INF 7420 Project - Wireframe
For my project, I am going to create a professional website that will include my e-Portfolio. I was planning on creating one anyone, once I graduated, but this way I get to create something that will also be included in my e-Portfolio.
## Wireframes
I have included wireframes for my home, meditations, and CV pages.
